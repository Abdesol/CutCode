<b>CutCode</b> is an open source project made for developers to boost their job by helping them save essential code snippets in safe place. 
<br> 
For example: Sometimes as a developer, we need to insert one code snippets in most of our projects and for doing that we go check previous projects and grab the code from there or Google it again. But using this app, you can get all this essential code snippets in one place. You can search through your codes, you can give them title and descriptions, You can add cells and every you can add whatever you want in every code cell and also you can add them to favourite codes so that you can get it quickly from the favourite codes page.
