<h1 style="color:Red">Why CutCode ❓</h1>
<hr>
<h3 style="color:Blue">
    As a developer, we often search on Google / StackOverFlow for doubts, issues related to our code and our projects,
    <br>
    when programming. As a result, we visit a lot of different posts, even different websites to find the right solution
    <br>
    to our problem, but many times when we see a proper solution to your problem, we tend to forget where we found it or
    <br>
    even the solution. Hence, we decided to create a tool that helps us remember and save our solutions as small
    <br>
    snippets, so that we never forget about it and access it whenever we need it.
    <br>
    CutCode is an open source tool made for developers to boost their productivity and save time by helping them save
    <br>
    essential code as code snippets in safe place. These code snippets can be searched and accessed at anytime. It is a
    <br>
    very helpful tool as you no longer need to remember your solutions and where you originally found them.
